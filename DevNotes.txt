OTHER NOTES: 
> the app.py has pretty scuffed, almost everything runs on one function- 
    the object detection, the screenshot & save process, the screenshot 
    metadata extraction, the data POST to DB. almost everything. Any
    suggestions on how to fix this?
    > Update: screenshot process is separated via its own function running in its own thread
> in later stage of development, do not plot detected objects if confidence is lower that .60
> Try implement color mask for better accuracy?
